# üî• MotivateMe

Motivational quote generator. This is fun little project intended to make people smile but also, wanted to build a small project so I can test out publishing this as a package on GitHub so other users within the company can pip install. This is to help get an idea of how we can build and distribute programs as we move towards having a code base.

Motivational quotes were downloaded from this website url and manually converted to a json file: https://sharpquotes.com/download-45500-famous-motivational-quotes-database-in-excel-and-pdf/#:~:text=Download%2045500%20Famous%20Motivational%20Quotes%20Database%20in%20Excel,class%20is%20running%20the%20country.%20...%20More%20items
